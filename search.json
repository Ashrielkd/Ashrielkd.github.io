    "text": "The college basketball relationship with the three-point shot has evolved as the line moved farther from the hoop going from 19 feet, to 20, and eventually to 22. With each step back, you’d expect fewer successes, but the data reveals something interesting not only did misses increase, but so did the number of shots MADE.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nboxscores &lt;- read_csv(\"ncaa_mens_team_box.csv\")\n\nteamseasons &lt;- boxscores |&gt; \n  group_by(season, team_short_display_name) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    total_three_point_attempts = sum(three_point_field_goals_attempted),\n    total_three_point_made = sum(three_point_field_goals_made)\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(season_three_point_pct = (total_three_point_made/total_three_point_attempts)*100) |&gt; \n  mutate(era =\n    case_when(\n      season == 2003 ~ \"19 feet three point line\",\n      season == 2004 ~ \"19 feet three point line\",\n      season == 2005 ~ \"19 feet three point line\",\n      season == 2006 ~ \"19 feet three point line\",\n      season == 2007 ~ \"19 feet three point line\",\n      season == 2008 ~ \"19 feet three point line\",\n      season == 2009 ~ \"20 feet three point line\",\n      season == 2010 ~ \"20 feet three point line\",\n      season == 2011 ~ \"20 feet three point line\",\n      season == 2012 ~ \"20 feet three point line\",\n      season == 2013 ~ \"20 feet three point line\",\n      season == 2014 ~ \"20 feet three point line\",\n      season == 2015 ~ \"20 feet three point line\",\n      season == 2016 ~ \"20 feet three point line\",\n      season == 2017 ~ \"20 feet three point line\",\n      season == 2018 ~ \"20 feet three point line\",\n      season == 2019 ~ \"20 feet three point line\",\n      season == 2020 ~ \"22 feet three point line\",\n      season == 2021 ~ \"22 feet three point line\",\n      season == 2022 ~ \"22 feet three point line\",\n      season == 2023 ~ \"22 feet three point line\",\n      season == 2024 ~ \"22 feet three point line\",\n      season == 2025 ~ \"22 feet three point line\",\n    ))\n\n\neras &lt;- teamseasons |&gt;\ngroup_by(era) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    avg_three_point_attempt= mean(total_three_point_attempts),\n    avg_three_point_made= mean(total_three_point_made)\n    ) |&gt;\n  mutate(avg_three_point_misses=avg_three_point_attempt-avg_three_point_made)\n\nera19 &lt;- c(\"Made\"=123.5469, \"Misses\"=231.0066)\nera20 &lt;- c(\"Made\"=127.4603, \"Misses\"=242.8541)\nera22 &lt;- c(\"Made\"=130.2392, \"Misses\"=256.3559)\n\niron(\nwaffle(\n        era19/10, \n        rows = 3, \n        colors = c(\"green\", \"red\")\n) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"19-foot three point line\",\n    title=\"The More The Merrier\", \n    subtitle=\"More distance leads to more misses — but made shots increase too\"\n    ) + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  ),\nwaffle(\n        era20/10, \n        rows = 3, \n        colors = c(\"green\", \"red\") \n) + \n  labs(\n    x= \"20-foot three point line\"\n  ),\nwaffle(\n        era22/10, \n        rows = 3, \n        colors = c(\"green\", \"red\")\n) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"22-foot three point line\",\n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | Graphic by Ashriel Dixon\"\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe different era of the three-point line, comparing average attempts, makes, and misses.

These high-volume shooters from the eras are just mind blowing. 19-foot , 20-foot, and the 22-foot line era seem backwards. The title says it all “The 19 Foot Line Has Left the Chat” a witty nod to how the top shooters now mostly come from eras where the line was pushed back. And yet, even with more distance, teams continue to chuck away, showing just how central the three-point shot has become.
